          In this project, we combine the existing traditional models and apply the new model to the MRI image detection of Alzheimer's disease to achieve the identification of different degrees of pathological stages. This project compares the characteristics of the old and new model structures and conducts in-depth experimental tests. On the basis of testing, we integrate the idea of improving the prediction accuracy of the model, and design the block-CNN structure to improve the accuracy of the traditional CNN model structure. At the same time, the attention mechanism of linear complexity is applied to the computer vision classification task, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of the model.

          With the rapid development of global road transportation, countries worldwide have completed the construction of road networks. However, the ensuing challenge lies in the maintenance of existing roads. It is well-known that countries allocate limited budgets to road maintenance projects, and road management departments face difficulties in making scientifically informed maintenance decisions. Therefore, integrating various artificial intelligence decision-making techniques to thoroughly explore historical maintenance data and adapt them to the context of road maintenance scientific decision-making has become an urgent issue. This integration aims to provide road management departments with more scientific tools and evidence for decision-making. The framework proposed in this paper primarily addresses the following four issues: 1) predicting the pavement performance of various routes, 2) determining the prioritization of maintenance routes, 3) making maintenance decisions based on the evaluation of the effects of past maintenance, and considering comprehensive technical and management indicators, and 4) determining the prioritization of maintenance sections based on the maintenance effectiveness and recommended maintenance effectiveness. By tackling these four problems, the framework enables intelligent decision-making for the optimal maintenance plan and maintenance sections, taking into account limited funding and historical maintenance management experience.

          Pavement performance prediction is the core technical difficulty in highway pavement management system, which has been limited by various factors such as analysis methods, insufficient data volume and low data dimension, resulting in a large deviation between the predicted value and the measured value of several existing performance prediction models. The pavement disease is analyzed by gray system (GM) in time series, and then the prediction value of various diseases is used as input, and the pavement condition index (PCI) is indirectly predicted with the help of artificial neural network (ANN), and a hybrid model based on artificial intelligence (GM-ANN) is constructed. The results show that the hybrid prediction model based on GM-ANN has better accuracy and operability, which can provide a more accurate and reliable reference for big data maintenance decisions in practical engineering applications.

          路面性能预测是公路路面管理系统中的核心技术难点,一直以来受限于分析手段、数据体量不足及数据维度低等多种因素影响,导致现有几类性能预测模型的预测值与实测值偏差较大.将路面病害以时间序列进行灰色系统(GM)分析,后以各类病害预测值为输入,借助人工神经网络(ANN)间接对路面状况指数(PCI)进行预测,构建基于人工智能的混合模型(GM-ANN).最后选用地区随机路段进行实例验证,并同常用模型预测结果进行对比分析.结果显示:基于GM-ANN的混合预测模型更具较好的精度及可操作性,在实际工程应用中,可为大数据养护决策提供更准确、可靠的参考依据.
