 Haoyu Sun who got MAI (Master in AI) degree in Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), he was born in 1996 in Inner Mongolia, and work with Dr. [Yan Yan](https://tomyan555.github.io/) (Tom Yan) who is currently a Gladwin Development Chair Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology.

 The main courses are: deep learning (computer vision), machine learning, NLP, probability graph models and bioinformatic etc. You can feel free to check the AI core course in [IIT](https://www.iit.edu/academics/programs/artificial-intelligence-mas/) website .

 GPA > 3.65 and the research directions are subdivided into: image detection and segmentation, bioinformatics analysis, and reliable intelligent decision-making framework.

          In this project, we combine the existing traditional models and apply the new model to the MRI image detection of Alzheimer's disease to achieve the identification of different degrees of pathological stages. This project compares the characteristics of the old and new model structures and conducts in-depth experimental tests. On the basis of testing, we integrate the idea of improving the prediction accuracy of the model, and design the block-CNN structure to improve the accuracy of the traditional CNN model structure. At the same time, the attention mechanism of linear complexity is applied to the computer vision classification task, which improves the efficiency and accuracy of the model.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
